# PRODIGY_CS_03
This is my 3rd task of **Prodigy summer internship** based on **Password Complexity Checker**.

It is a tool or set of rules designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on certain criteria. These criteria are intended to ensure that passwords are resistant to common attacks like brute force, dictionary attacks, and guessing.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what typically goes into a password complexity check:

**Minimum Length**: Passwords should be at least a certain number of characters long, often between 8 and 12 characters.

**Maximum Length**: Some systems impose a maximum length to prevent abuse, though this is less common.

**Uppercase Letters:** Inclusion of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).

**Lowercase Letters**: Inclusion of at least one lowercase letter (a-z).

**Special Characters**: Inclusion of at least one special character, such as !, @, #, $, %, &, etc.

**Sequential Characters**: Avoid sequences like "1234" or "abcd".

**Repetitive Characters**: Avoid using repetitive characters like "aaaaaa" or "111111".
